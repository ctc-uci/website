### Webmaster Notes

The website is intentionally designed to need as minimal changes as possible where many of your changes should be contained in the images director (`/public`) and in the [ `/utils/constants`](https://github.com/ctc-uci/website/tree/main/src/utils/constants) directory

The bulk of your work should just be updating images :D
